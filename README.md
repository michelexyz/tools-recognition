# tools-recognition
This project was assigned to me and a fellow student by the university for the image processing exam.<br>
Its purpose is to recognize 10 categories of mechanical tools.<br>
Since deep learning wasn't included in the syllabus we tried to reach our goal using only statistical reasoning and classifiers.<br>
